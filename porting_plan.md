# Porting Plan: PureMVC AS3 AsyncCommand Utility to TypeScript

1.  Analyze the AS3 codebase to understand the structure and functionality.
    *   Locate the main classes in the AS3 project.
    *   Identify dependencies between classes.
    *   Understand the flow of state transitions.
    *   Document key functionalities.
2.  Set up the TypeScript project with the necessary dependencies (PureMVC).
    *   Configure the new TypeScript project in the current folder
    *   Install the PureMVC TypeScript MultiCore framework.
    *   Configure the project with tsconfig.json, eslint
3.  Port the async command logic.
    *   Port the State class.
    *   Port the StateMachine class.
    *   Port any other core classes.
    *   Implement state transition logic.
4. Write unit tests.
    *   Write unit tests for the core state machine logic.
    *   Write unit tests for the FSMInjector with JSON configuration.
    *   Ensure sufficient code coverage.
5. Documentation
    *   Create README with instructions on how to use the library.
    *   Document the API.
6.  Review and refine the ported code, tests, and documentation.
